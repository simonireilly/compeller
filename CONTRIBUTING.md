# Contributing

We are not sure what contributing looks like yet, so for now it will be ad-hoc.


## Releases

Currently releases are managed by release-it and run locally from `main`.

Automating canary releases would be nice.


```bash
yarn pub:canary
```

If we decide to cut a patch we can go for:

```bash
yarn pub:main
```
